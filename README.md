# Business Continuity Trends Analysis Report

## Introduction

This report presents an analysis of business continuity trends on various commercial corridors based on continuously active businesses. The analysis focuses on businesses that were active in 2015 and examines how many of them are still active on the same corridor in 2023.

## Data Sources

The analysis is based on Business Tax ID Data for the years 2015 and 2023. The data is divided by commercial corridors, with columns M-T indicating the corridor on which each property is located. Some properties are located on multiple corridors due to intersections, and they have been included in the analysis for all relevant corridors. The "Control Number" column serves as a unique identifier for each business.

## Analysis

### Part A: Number of Businesses Still Active

In this section, we determine how many businesses that were active on each corridor in 2015 are still active on the same corridor in 2023. To achieve this, we:

1. Create a list of control numbers in 2015 that were listed as "active" for each commercial corridor.
2. Exclude any businesses in 2015 that were marked as "inactive."
3. Identify control numbers that still exist in the 2023 dataset and meet the following criteria:
   - Have a "Business Status" of "Active" in the 2023 dataset.
   - Have the same Property Identification Number (PIN) and address in both 2015 and 2023.

### Part B: Percentage of Businesses Still Active

In this section, we calculate the percentage of businesses that were on each corridor in 2015 and are still active on the same corridor in 2023. The percentage is calculated for each individual corridor.

## Conclusion

This analysis provides insights into the continuity of businesses on various commercial corridors from 2015 to 2023. It allows us to understand how many businesses have remained active on the same corridor and the percentage of businesses that have successfully continued their operations.

The results of this analysis can be used by relevant stakeholders to make informed decisions regarding commercial development and support for businesses on these corridors.
